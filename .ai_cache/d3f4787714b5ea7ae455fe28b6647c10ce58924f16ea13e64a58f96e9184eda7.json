Initial requests to '/city/' likely redirect to a search results page based on location. Examine network traffic to understand data loading mechanisms (often involving AJAX calls to retrieve listing data).  Look for structured data (JSON-LD) within the HTML as Redfin often includes it for SEO purposes.
