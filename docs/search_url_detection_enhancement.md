# Search URL Detection Enhancement

## Problem

The Ohio Broker Direct test was failing due to two separate issues:

1. The `name` property in `FormSearchEngine` was being called as a method rather than accessed as a property
2. The search page detection logic was not properly prioritizing URLs with "search" in them, causing the scraper to use less relevant pages for form submission

## Solution

### 1. Name Property Fix

The `name` method in the `FormSearchEngine` class was converted to a property using the `@property` decorator. All references to `engine.name()` were updated to use `engine.name` across the codebase.

### 2. Enhanced Search URL Detection

We implemented a more sophisticated search URL detection system:

1. **URL Scoring System**:
   - URLs with "search" in the path now receive a much higher score (10-20 points)
   - URLs containing related terms like "properties", "homes", etc. receive medium scores (5-8 points)
   - URLs with search-related query parameters receive additional points
   - URLs found via link text also contribute to scoring

2. **Prioritization**:
   - URLs are now sorted by score, ensuring the most relevant search URLs are tried first
   - URLs explicitly containing "/search/" in their path are prioritized the highest
   - URLs with search terms in query parameters (e.g., "q=", "query=") also get higher scores

3. **Form Detection Improvement**:
   - Forms on pages with "search" in the URL get a higher detection score
   - Real estate specific terms in forms are now better recognized
   - The URL context is now considered when scoring form relevance

## Results

With these changes, the system now:

1. Correctly identifies the most relevant search pages
2. Prioritizes URLs that explicitly contain "search" in the path
3. Makes better decisions about which form to use for search operations

This enhances the scraper's ability to find and use the correct search forms across various websites, particularly real estate sites like Ohio Broker Direct.

## Future Improvements

1. Further refine the scoring system based on more domain-specific knowledge
2. Improve form detection for websites with non-standard search implementations
3. Add site-specific adapters for known real estate websites
