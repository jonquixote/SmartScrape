# Form Search Engine Name Property Fix

## Issue Description
The Ohio Broker Direct test was failing due to an issue with the `name` method in the `FormSearchEngine` class. The `name` method was incorrectly being treated as a function rather than a property, resulting in errors like `'str' object is not callable`.

## Root Cause
- The `name` method was defined as a regular method in the `FormSearchEngine` class, but in some cases it was assigned a string value and then later code attempted to call it as a method.
- This caused the TypeError: `'str' object is not callable` because a string doesn't have a `__call__` method.

## Changes Made

1. **Changed `name` from method to property in `FormSearchEngine`**:
   ```python
   @property
   def name(self) -> str:
       """
       Get the name of the search engine.
       
       Returns:
           str: Engine name
       """
       return "form_search_engine"
   ```

2. **Updated `register_search_engine` decorator in `base_strategy.py`**:
   ```python
   # Changed from:
   engine_name = engine_instance.name()
   # To:
   engine_name = engine_instance.name
   ```

3. **Updated all code that was calling `name()` to use it as a property**:
   - In `form_strategy.py`: Changed `self.name()` to `self.name`
   - In `multi_strategy.py`: Changed all instances of `engine.name()` to `engine.name`
   - In `enhanced_ohio_test.py`: Changed `form_strategy.name()` to `form_strategy.name`
   - In `test_form_strategy_name.py`: Updated test to use `name` as a property
   - In `debug_ohio_broker_test.py`: Updated validation to check for property instead of method

## Testing
1. Created a verification script (`verify_name_property_fix.py`) that confirms the property works correctly
2. Updated and ran the `test_form_strategy_name.py` file
3. Successfully ran the Ohio Broker Direct test without errors

## Future Considerations
1. Consider adding more comprehensive tests to verify property access across all strategy classes
2. Ensure consistent usage of properties vs. methods in the codebase
3. Add validation checks to prevent similar issues from occurring in future code changes

## Notes
This change represents a breaking change to the API, as code that was previously calling `name()` now needs to use `name` as a property. All known usages have been updated, but it's possible there are other places in the codebase using this method that might need updating.
