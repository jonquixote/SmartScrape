## Implementation Notes

### Primary Achievements

The pipeline architecture implementation has successfully delivered:

1. A flexible and extensible framework for content extraction
2. Significant improvements in error handling and recovery
3. Enhanced monitoring and metrics collection
4. Standardized interfaces for all processing stages
5. Configuration-driven pipeline creation

### Lessons Learned

Key insights from the implementation process:

1. Early focus on interfaces and contracts allowed parallel development of different components
2. Comprehensive test suite with fixtures was essential for reliable development
3. Incremental migration approach allowed verification without disrupting existing systems
4. Clear documentation from the beginning accelerated adoption
5. Performance considerations need to be addressed early in design

### Current Challenges

Areas that require continued attention:
