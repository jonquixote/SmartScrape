Okay, I have reviewed the existing requirements.txt and the code definitions in the components, extraction, and strategies/ai_guided directories. The project is already quite comprehensive, covering core scraping, extraction, and AI-guided navigation/analysis.

Given the goal of building an app that can scrape any site for anything, here are some additional package suggestions, focusing on areas that could enhance robustness, flexibility, and scalability:

Enhanced Web Scraping & Anti-Bot Measures:

undetected-chromedriver: If playwright-stealth proves insufficient against sophisticated anti-bot systems, using a patched ChromeDriver can sometimes bypass detection.
Integration with Proxy Services: Packages or libraries to easily integrate with commercial proxy providers (e.g., Bright Data, Oxylabs) for IP rotation and geo-targeting, crucial for large-scale or geographically restricted scraping. This would likely involve using httpx or aiohttp with proxy configurations.
More Flexible Data Extraction:

jsonpath-ng: For extracting data from JSON structures, which are increasingly common in web responses (APIs, embedded data).
Consider libraries for schema validation (e.g., jsonschema, pydantic - already in use for FastAPI but could be leveraged more broadly) to ensure extracted data conforms to expected structures.
Advanced Content Analysis and Understanding:

sentence-transformers: To generate vector embeddings of text content. This could significantly improve the LinkPrioritizer and ContentAnalyzer by allowing for semantic similarity comparisons between user intent and page content, rather than just keyword matching.
faiss-cpu or annoy: Efficient similarity search libraries that pair well with sentence-transformers for quickly finding the most relevant content or links based on embeddings.
Scalability and Distributed Processing:

Redis (with redis-py): A fast in-memory data structure store that can be used as a message broker for Celery (mentioned previously) or for caching, managing job queues, and storing temporary scraping state across distributed workers.
APScheduler or schedule: For scheduling scraping jobs at specific times or intervals.
Configuration and Secrets Management:

Vault (with hvac): For securely storing and accessing sensitive information like API keys and proxy credentials, especially important if deploying the application.
Data Export and Reporting:

reportlab: If generating PDF reports from scraped data is a requirement
